   This chapter describes some internals of this extension to let you extend it
   easily.


Assets such as PDF, images, documents, ... are uploaded to TYPO3. Metadata
extraction services are called, one after another, based on their advertised
priority or quality. These services are the various extraction classes you find
under :file:`Classes/Service/Extraction/`).

The service classes invoke the actual wrappers to the extraction tools (Apache
Tika, ExifTool, PHP, ...) to be found under :file:`Classes/Service/{Wrapper}/`.

In order to map the data format used by the various extraction tools to the FAL
metadata structure used by TYPO3, a JSON-based configuration file is used. Those
mapping configuration files can be found under
:file:`Configuration/Services/{Wrapper}/`.

.. _developer-manual-json:

JSON mapping configuration file
-------------------------------

A mapping configuration file is of the form:

.. code-block:: json

   [
     {
       "FAL": "caption",
       "DATA": "CaptionAbstract"
     },
     {
       "FAL": "color_space",
       "DATA": [
         "ColorSpaceData",
         "ColorSpace->Causal\\Extractor\\Utility\\ColorSpace::normalize"
       ]
     }
   ]

FAL
   This is the name (column) of the metadata in FAL.

DATA
   This is either a unique key or an array of ordered keys to be checked for
   content in the extracted metadata. In addition, an arbitrary post-processor
   may be specified using the ``->`` array notation.

   A configuration helper tool is available in Extension Manager, prior to TYPO3 v11.


.. _developer-manual-hook:

Hook
----

The method ``\Causal\Extractor\Service\Extraction\AbstractExtractionService::getDataMapping()``
is the central method invoked to map extracted metadata to FAL properties.
Developers may dynamically alter the mapping by hooking into the process using
``$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTCONF']['extractor']['dataMappingHook']``.


.. _developer-manual-signal:

Signal after extraction
-----------------------

Once the meta data has been extracted, a signal is emitted, which allows other
extensions to process the file further. The Signal can be connected to a Slot as
follows (e.g., in file file:`ext_localconf.php` of your extension).


**Registration in TYPO3 v8 and v9**

.. code-block:: php

   // Initiate SignalSlotDispatcher
   $signalSlotDispatcher = \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility::makeInstance(
       \TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\SignalSlot\Dispatcher::class
   );

   // Connect the Signal "postMetaDataExtraction" to a Slot
   $signalSlotDispatcher->connect(
       \Causal\Extractor\Service\AbstractService::class,
       'postMetaDataExtraction',
       \VENDOR\MyExtension\Service\Extractor::class,
       'enhanceMetadata'
   );

This requires a PHP class ``\VENDOR\MyExtension\Service\Extractor`` and a
method ``enhanceMetadata()`` in this class:

.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   namespace VENDOR\MyExtension\Service;

   use TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\FileInterface;

   class Extractor
   {
       public function enhanceMetadata(FileInterface $file, array &$metadata): void
       {
           // your code
       }
   }


**Registration since TYPO3 v10**

The signal slot dispatcher is deprecated since TYPO3 v10 and you should instead
register a middleware by creating file :file:`Configuration/Services.yaml`
within your extension:

.. code-block:: yaml

   services:
     _defaults:
       autowire: true
       autoconfigure: true
       public: false

     VENDOR\MyExtension\EventListener\ExtractorEventListener:
       tags:
         - name: event.listener
           identifier: 'causal/extractor'
           method: 'postMetaDataExtraction'
           event: Causal\Extractor\Resource\Event\AfterMetadataExtractedEvent

.. caution::

   Be sure to module Admin Tools > Maintenance and to flush the TYPO3 and PHP
   Cache when you register middlewares.

This requires a PHP class
``\VENDOR\MyExtension\EventListener\ExtractorEventListener`` and a method
``enhanceMetadata()`` in this class:

.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   namespace VENDOR\MyExtension\EventListener;

   use Causal\Extractor\Resource\Event\AfterMetadataExtractedEvent;

   class Extractor
   {
       public function postMetaDataExtraction(AfterMetadataExtractedEvent $event): void
       {
           // your code
       }
   }

.. _developer-manual-signal-categories:

Associated TYPO3 categories
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

By default TYPO3 categories are automatically assigned using keywords found in
the metadata due to the mapping associating them to the special FAL field
``__categories__``. This virtual field expects a comma-separated list of TYPO3
category **titles**.

Since version 2.1.0, we added another special FAL field ``__category_uids__``
which works similarly but expecting a comma-separated list of category **uids**
instead. One would use the signal/event and expand extracted metadata with a
custom business logic.

An real-life example is using the geographical coordinates latitude/longitude,
send them to the
`Google reverse geocoding service <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview?hl=en_US#ReverseGeocoding>`__
to translate them into a human-readable address and thus populating the fields
"location", "region" and "country" and possibly assign geographical-related
TYPO3 categories based on the API output.
